    						  <h2>Descirbe the text</h2>
								<p>"Bad Indians" is a memoir written by Deborah Miranda, a former WLU professor. The book focuses on Miranda's family history, her personal experiences, and her ancestral Californian Indigenous communities. Miranda uses a non-linear and fragmented narrative style, incorporating different voices and perspectives.</p>
    					</div>
    					<div class="col">
      						<h3>What container is it in? Is that container unique or one of many copies?</h3>
								<p>The container is a book, although inside, it is formatted uniquely, including pictures and a little bit of history of Indigenous people. The container itself is not unique, as there are many copies.</p>
    					</div>
  						</div>
  					<div class="row">
    					<div class="col">
      						<h4>Is it published? How can you access the text? Can you buy it or check it out of the library? Print or digital or both? What other forms might exist?</h4>
								<p>It is published by "Heyday," a publishing company. You can access this book in a variety of ways. The first time I was introduced to the text was in a PDF in my poverty studies class when my professor told us to read it because I was going to do a presentation on it. It is available both digitally and in print, and it can be bought or checked out from a library. In 50 years, people can still read it because it will be available in print and digitally.</p>
    					</div>
    					<div class="col">
      						<h5>How did this text come to be?</h5>
								<p> I am not sure about how this text came to be, but I know it is deeply personal, and she probably made it to share her story so others can see the intersectionality of being a poor Indigenous woman.</p>
    					</div>
    					<div class="col">
      						<h6>Could it be studied by a scholar?</h6>
								<p>As I mentioned before, as this book explores the intersectionality of being a poor minority woman, it can definitely be studied by scholars. </p>

		<h8>Which of our definitions of text seems to apply here? </h8>
			<br>
			<br>
			<p> I would definitely say that this book fits all the descriptions of text. It is similar to text in the computer science way because people can adjust the words and alter the appearance of the words. I would also say that it fits the definition of text as a visualizer of communication because it communicates a story of self. I would also say that the text itself is also sharing and informing which we had mentioned in class that text tends to do.</p>
		<h9> Why do I enjoy the book so much? </h9> 
			<div class="blueDiv"> <p>When I first read this book it resonated with me becuase it was something that was similar to my experiance, but not only that, but it made me reflect on what forgiveness is. The book offer an invaluble lessons and realities of life and poverty.</p> </div>
